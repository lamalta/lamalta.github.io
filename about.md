# why ?

The world is in a critical point. First time in the history all the world is united, like a global community. Same needs and same problems touch each of us

Now more than ever, the control of ressources, education, healing system, etc.. belongs in a small group of people, ruling all the others
Social and justice, environment disasters, spiritual pureness, violence

People are more than ever separated from the others and from the normal natural way of living. Humanity and mother earth need people to accept the challenge to be really human, connected, who cares, and do the best

That’s why, because we care and believe in this living transition to a more enlightened world. Hopefully, there is so many tools, so much knowledge that we can use, so much experiences from the past, and so many people, groups, actions existing right now with care.

Let’s unite

# who are we ? our vision & philosophy. what we expect ?

what we do is like life: it is growing already, it is a process, a transition that will happen anyway
we are volonteers that care about things and want to build things that correspond to values
we care about things, we care about each of us
we want to solve problems we have: go out of slavery, personnal, society, ... everything
not to spend energy building things, but understand and now how the natural works to live with it
we try to create a good ground for the seeds to grow
to protect the already existing ground before it gets damaged
we want to celebrate the gift of living, experience
understand who we are and what are our abilities in a free human existence
… to pass this to the next generation
we have to promote self-conscious and auto determination, free thinking for all
we are a open group of people based in la palma, wanting to buy a piece of land to start somewhere !

# where are we ?

we are everywhere, but our heart beats in la Palma
