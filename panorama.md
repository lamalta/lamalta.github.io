# Practical cycles of activity
> When people work together, they are unstoppable

We create 9 basic cycles of activities and try to unite people in common action with same dream. The same moment all thematically cycles support each others activity's and they part of a big democratic and conscious powerful tool. 

1. ARTS

We recognize that every human is unique and that everyone have his personal path to be healthy. We recognize that prolipsy is the best way to be healthy. We move on to create a natural health center. The official health system can save our life in some cases, but general lines is under the control of big pharmaceutical and petrol companies only interested by profit. There is so much knowledge now, so many different ways for humans to live in health and in balance. We want to bring all the healers and all this knowledge and tools of natural healing in an open space for everyone.

# How we can synchronize
First and more important think is the relationships. One basic truth in no violence communication, is that every problem in the relationships exist because there is a need that we could not communicate. We need to find the language that every heart can understand with the some way. 
We need to see the things that can unite us if we wish to be part of this change.
