## find the balance
	listen to cycles: of the earth, of bodies

## love strong, trust life
	make you and the others feel good
	go beyond yourself
	watch the consequences on the outside

## slow down, tranquilo
	live simple, use less, re-use
	eat slow, breath deep
	see the order in the chaos and the chaos in the order

## don't take it personal
	know your ego and work on it
	go over personalities

## gather and celebrate
	make parties, music, art
	have fun, play
	don't take it seriously

## learn and teach
	always at the same time

## agriculture is the first of all cultures
	exchange all seeds
	share recipes & processes, not just results

## avoid monoculture
	measure, count is the root of capitalism

## think global
	observe and understand
	avoid mediations, do not delegate to much
	get means of production

## all the universe is in me
	but do not try to understand everything
	we can not understand the universe
	we do not need to understand the universe

## travel around
	learn to read the landscape
	keep groups small

## act local
	solution is always within small groups
	organize around energy flows
	use your energy where it can affect the most change
	embrace cooperation, highlight the commun
	face difficulties
	feet in the ground, heart in the sky

## everything contributes, everyone creates
	welcome the unknown
	find the balance
	individually we are powerful, together we are unstoppable

## the solution is within the problem
	go with the river, not against it
	there are more solutions than problems
	don't force anything, but strongly resist to external powers
	don't take decisions if you're not involved in the making or consequences of them
	
## use your energy 
	to make new things that make the old system obsolete
	for emancipation & autonomy

## stay free, follow none
	« act different, dot it just »
	don't loose time in well known mainstreams
	use your edge
	don't trust yourself neither the others
	listen to intentions to understand messages
