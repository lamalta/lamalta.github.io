## respeta Gaia
	proteger Tierra y su diversidad
	todos los recursos son regalos

## respeta humano
    sociedad : ser completamente humano, libre, independiente
    todo lo que esta a contra de eso no se debe cooperar
    
## find the balance
	listen to cycles of the earth, of bodies
	life is made of changes & transformations
	see the order in the chaos and the chaos in the order
	top medicine: sun, water, rest, air, sport, food

## the solution is within the problem
	go with the river, not against it
	there are more solutions than problems
	communicate your needs
	don't force anything, but strongly resist to external powers
	only take decisions if involved in the making or consequences of them
	truth must remain unspotten & unspoken (?)

## love strong, trust life
	make you and the others feel good
	watch the consequences on the outside
	deep respect & care about what's around
	forgive
	the only remedy to loneliness is solitude

## slow down, tranquilo
	live simple, use less, re-use
	eat slow, breath deep
	be patient, take your time
	share your feelings

## don't take it personal
	go beyond yourself
	know your ego and work on it
	go over personalities
	non violent communication

## do not measure
	we are made of feelings
	emotions are unique

## gather and celebrate
	make parties, music, art
	have fun, play
	don't take it seriously

## emancipation, education
	learn and teach always at the same time

## agriculture, first of all cultures
	exchange all seeds
	share recipes & processes, not just results

## avoid monoculture
	measure, count is the root of capitalism
	make life a living art
	decentralization holds the key our freedom

## think global
	borderless
	observe and understand
	everything is connected
	avoid mediations, do not delegate to much
	get means of production
	boycott companies & massmedias

## all the universe is in me
	but do not try to understand everything
	we can not understand the universe
	we do not need to understand the universe

## travel around
	learn to read the landscape
	keep groups small

## act local
	solution is always within small groups
	organize around energy flows
	use your energy where it can affect the most change
	embrace cooperation, highlight the commun
	face difficulties
	feet in the ground, heart in the sky
	beware of mediations: within intermediaries lies power

## everything contributes, everyone creates
	welcome the unknown
	individually we are powerful, together we are unstoppable
	share the abundance

## use your energy 
	to make new things that make the old system obsolete
	for emancipation & autonomy
	discipline & practice

## stay free, follow none
	« act different, dot it just »
	don't loose time in well known mainstreams
	use your edge
	don't trust yourself neither the others
	listen to intentions to understand messages
	majority doesn't always have the truth
