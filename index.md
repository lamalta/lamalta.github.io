Back to root, back to earth, to balance, to peace, back to simplicity and pureness with intelligent ways, with new points of view.
We respond in this calling, this challenge to be a human being with a truly open and creativity living experience
Me, you, we.
Material, practical objects and things, in totally mirrored of ideals and beliefs
All one with bridges of cocreative love, show to us that another world is already here.
Enjoy with harmony

don't say
that i am very small or the responsability to save the world
say: i and only i have the responsibility to save the world

know the vibrations of the fear, pain

pain, fear, human natural = death
not being loved that we are not the god
the mistake happen when you want to control the bad weather.
i am the god and i rule my live, i am the god

we care about it
we care about the unknown

material world is not. the symbols yes
by the symbols we affects the spirit of people

we are tired of listening
just the good thing, just that

first we'll receive until the last cent of good & bad things
the power that we cannot explain
it will decide at the end

manifestation, feeling, why is the universe here ?

real freedom and life is to have passion, experience, i need everything not to be known from before
happyness

evolution is to go back accept again 

only pain
